nixfiles
========

My [NixOS][] configuration and assorted other crap. Clone to `/etc/nixos` and produce a new
configuration.nix file based off the example ones.

### Naming convention

*Beings* (elder gods, outer gods, people, etc) in the Cthulhu Mythos for local machines; *places* in
the Cthulhu Mythos for remote machines (even though there's only one of those currently).
